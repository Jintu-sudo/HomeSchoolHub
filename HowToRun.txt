    run : Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

4. Start the development server
-------------------------------
Run this command to start the app locally:
    mongod --dbpath "C:\HomeSchoolHub\server\data\db"     
    nodemon index.js
    npm run start-legacy

This will start the React development server, usually on:

    http://localhost:3000

Open this URL in your web browser to see the app running.

5. Using the App
----------------
- The app allows you to add, edit, and delete events.
- Events are saved locally in your browserâ€™s localStorage.
- The calendar shows events by date.
- You must be logged in (or mock login depending on your context) to save your own events.

6. Build for production (optional)
----------------------------------
To create an optimized production build, run:

    npm run build

This will generate a `build` folder with static files that you can deploy.

7. Additional Notes
-------------------
- Make sure you have an internet connection to fetch dependencies on the first install.
- If you have any issues or questions, please open an issue in the repository.
