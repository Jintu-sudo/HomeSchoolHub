      <h3>What Are Shapes?</h3>
      <p>Shapes are forms or outlines of objects. Look around â€” everything you see has a shape!</p>

      <h5>Common Shapes:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Circle</strong> â€“ Round and smooth (like a coin)</li>
        <li><strong>Square</strong> â€“ 4 equal sides and 4 corners</li>
        <li><strong>Rectangle</strong> â€“ 4 sides with opposite sides equal</li>
        <li><strong>Triangle</strong> â€“ 3 sides and 3 corners</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Where Do We See Shapes?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clock â†’ Circle</li>
        <li>Door â†’ Rectangle</li>
        <li>Road signs â†’ Triangle or Square</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What Is Space?</h3>
      <p>
        Space is the area around or inside shapes. Understanding space helps us figure out <strong>position</strong> and <strong>distance</strong>.
      </p>

      <h5>Spatial Concepts:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Above / Below</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Near / Far</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Left / Right</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Inside / Outside</strong></li>
      </ul>
